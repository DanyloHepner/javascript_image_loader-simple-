# Javascript Image Previewer

This sample is to show how to use FileReader object in Javascript so that we can see what picture we selected.

## Description
Actually, as everyone knows, we use input element with type of file to upload a file onto the html page temporarily.
But I don't like seeing itself.
So I decided to hide itself and make another button.
Well, here, I made it, but I didn't provide some auxilary css effects because that's not point which I'm saying.

### What it does
As I mentioned above, it only loads an image (only image not other types of file) and then previews it to users.
After preview, there isn't another action or special effect.
Well, if someone give me an opinion about that, I will fix certainly.

### Why I used only HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Because 
1. These 3 things are the basics of web development.
2. With only these 3 things, it was enough to make this small and simple program.

### Obstacles which I ever met while I was making this
To be honest, I made this all at once (almost) so I have nothing to mention about them especially here.

## How to Install
It's simple. Only clone it then you can see the result. Too simple to explain, thank you.

## How to use
Umm...I didn't make it for any use case. It's only sample code for using in several works which will need this codes.
I seperated into 3 files only - *.html, *.css and *.js.
